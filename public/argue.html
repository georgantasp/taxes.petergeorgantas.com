  <strong>Argument 1</strong>
  <small>The reassessment in Oct 2013 was unfair.</small>
</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Notification was not provided by the township until the end of Jan 2014. Discovery of the reassessment only occured after a review of our escrow account. It was only after phone calls and questions were raised to the township, that we then received a green assessment card dated Jan 28, 2013.</li>
    <li>During the investigation of the new assessment, we were led to believe by multiple individuals at the town offices (Margaret and Janice) that the assessment may have been a result of a renovation permit completed in June 2013. Further questions to this permit provided no results. We fear this inaccuracy may have played some role in the high reassessment in Oct 2013. The permit office confirms that no major renovations occurred since 2005.</li>
    <li>Comparable sales dated after 2012 show assessments which are lower than ours despite having higher sale prices. Additionally, other sales with low tax ratios were not reassessed at all.</li>
  </ul>

  <strong>Argument 2</strong>
  <small>Sale price is above market value and assessment is far above fair value.</small>
</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Sale price was driven up by a limited market and an extremely narrow search criteria. After searching for 4 months in the Collingswood, Haddon Township and Haddonfield areas, 421 Albany Avenue was the first listing that met our criteria.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Less than 10 minute walk to a PATCO station</li>
      <li>Under 2000 square feet, but with room for a family</li>
      <li>Under $9000 in taxes</li>
    </ul>
    <li>The home was originally listed at $390k. After a long and difficult negotiation, we landed at a sale price of $375k. Even though we still felt $375k was more than it was worth, we decided overpaying for a home we truly loved would be better than getting a good deal on a home we did not.</li>
    <li>The previous owner had the benefit of advertising low taxes to help the sale. This was especially true in our case. If we had known the taxes would climb to $10,300 the very next year, we would have not considered this home at all. Now, given the new reassessment, the high taxes hurt the value of the home.</li>
  </ul>
