<blockquote>
  <p>To whom it may concern,</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the property owners at 421 Albany Avenue, Haddon Township, NJ, we are requesting a review and adjustment to our assessment in two parts.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we request that the assessment for the second half of 2013 be reverted to $252,400. The adjustment that occurred in October 2013 was unfair and we believe the accompanying tax adjustment of $859.69 should be refunded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we request that the assessment for 2014 be reduced. We understand the townshipâ€™s need to have accurate assessments. However, we believe a fair assessment for our property for 2014 should be $275,000. This number would reflect what we feel is the fair market value of $340,000 and a ratio of 0.809.</p>

<p>
Please review the arguments and comparables.
